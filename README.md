# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex!

### :computer: Professional Background
I am a pre-sales engineer. I currently work as a customer engineer at Sourcegraph. Prior to Sourcegraph, I was a solutions architect at Andela. In both roles I am the technical resource embedded with the sales team to help customers solve their technical problems.

Prior to pre-sales engineering, I worked at a few different companies in New York and San Francisco as a **software engineer** and as a **team lead**, focusing mostly on Ruby on Rails applications. I got to spend a lot of time tinkering with a variety of ad technologies and building software that mapped to complex financial and legal regulations.

### :blue_heart: What I love working on
I love improving processes and communication and workflows with my teams and customers. I also love to geek out over the intersection of media and business and technology. :computer: :iphone: :dollar:

Whether it's in a functional, managerial, or sales-adjacent role, I do my best work at the intersection of **people and technology**.

### :bike:  About me
Beyond tech, I really enjoy cooking, running, hiking, biking, and traveling.

I'm currently based in Philadelphia, PA. I am originally from NJ and spent the greater part of a decade living in Brooklyn.
