# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex!

### :computer: Professional Background
I currently work as a Customer Engineer at Sourcegraph. I tend to focus on pre-sales (sales/solutions engineering), but I've done a bit of everything at Sourcegarph: helping with post-sales, team leadership, etc.

I spent most of 2024 at Sourcegraph in a professional services capacity as our very first Resident Architect, where I worked with our largest customers on post-sales usage of Sourcegraph Cody. In that role I paired deeply with some of the largest companies in the world on how they use GenAI in their software development process.

Prior to Sourcegraph, I was a solutions architect at Andela. 

Before that I spent nearly six years as a software developer. I worked at a few different companies in New York and San Francisco as a **software engineer** and as a **team lead**, focusing mostly on Ruby on Rails applications. I got to spend a lot of time tinkering with a variety of ad technologies and building software that mapped to complex financial and legal regulations.

### :blue_heart: What I love working on
I'm currently doing quite a bit with GenAI and the SDLC. I love solving hard problems, improving processes and communication, and building cool solutions with my teams and customers. I also love to geek out over the intersections of media, finance, business and technology. :computer: :iphone: :dollar:

Whether it's in a functional, managerial, or sales-adjacent role, I do my best work at the intersection of **people and technology**.

### :bike:  About me
Beyond tech, I really enjoy cooking, running, hiking, biking, and traveling.

I'm based in Brooklyn, NY.
